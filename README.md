# README for seinfeld-website-group-2-project
Custom website about the sitcom, Seinfeld, created by group 2 in MMC5277.

## Overview of development process
### Responsibilites
- Ian was the group leader and created the home/intro page.
- Sam created the characters page.
- Rachel created the influence page and the style guide.
- Matt created the ratings page and was key to helping us figure out coding challenges.
### Challenges
- We struggled to get our nav menu links to work, but eventually figured it out. We realized all of our HTML files needed to be in the root directory and not in subfolders.
- Sam had trouble pushing her changes locally, so the version of her page that is live is an older version of her page (the header looks different from the rest of the pages.
- On the intro (home) page, I couldn't figure out how to float my image neatly to the right of the body text and had to mess with the width of the text container and the image, so it looks a bit wonky when scaling the screen up or down. It also has mixed results on various screen sizes.
